A simple app used to bypass Iran's internet censorship
Works with many websites that are blocked in Iran

You can simply use GCC(Linux) Or MinGW(Windows) to build the App, no extra dependencies are needed.
Also you are able to build the project using VisualStudio
# How-To-Use
Run the app on your computer (No administrator priviledges required)
the app will bind to localhost:5585, and acts as an HTTP/HTTPS Proxy, so config your browser to use it as proxy.
